Lists in HTML is in 3 ways
1) Ordered lists : Some lists needs an order to represent the items. those are defined by ordered lists. ordered
lists use 'OL' tag. each item list inside the list use 'li' tag
li*3 -- short cut to have 3 lists

<ol>
  <li>abc</li>
</ol>
by default number will be assigned as type 
we have five types (1,A,a,i,I)

we can also start from where ever we want by defining start attribute

2) Unordered lists : 
  These lists are used when the order is not important

  It used 'ul' tag

  we can use types as circle , none , square and default is bullet points


3) Definition/Description Lists

history
